I'm trying to learn HTML and these are my basic HTML projects.

--- PROJECTS ---
1) I created a personal website using basic HTML structures.
  -->What I gained from this project: I learned link structures, tables and formatting thoroughly.

2) I created a website where I listed my favorite books in a table, embedded source links, and used form tags to get book recommendations from users.
   -->What I gained from this project: I learn about table and iframe structures thoroughly.
